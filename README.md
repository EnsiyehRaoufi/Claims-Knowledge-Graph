# Claims-Knowledge-Graph
Here I classify existing claims in the Claimskg knowledge graph to True/False/Other claims.

I've uploaded the csv file of the graph in the directory and it is named "claimskg_result.csv". I used the web interface explorer in this [address](https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/explorer/home).
